# Forza Mods AIO

Forza Mods AIO is a free FH4 and FH5 mod tool that aims to bring cool, new and unique features, all at NO cost!

## What does this project do?

It improves the player experience by adding various time saving and quality of life features.<br/>
These additions are designed to streamline gameplay, improve user satisfaction, and elevate the overall enjoyment of the gaming experience.

## Why is this project useful?

The AIO significantly enhances your gaming experience in FH4 and 5. It provides time-saving and quality-of-life features, ensuring you have more fun while playing.
Plus, it's completely free, making these enhancements accessible to everyone.

## How It Works?

This tool uses [merik's](https://github.com/szaaamerik) [memory.dll library](https://github.com/szaaamerik/memory.andy.dll) to perform signature scans for different functions and offsets.<br/>
The result from the scans is then used to create detours to power the features within the tool.
